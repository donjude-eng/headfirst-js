    <h2>Notice that arrays are zero-based. So the first
        bubble solution is solution #0 and has the score in
        scores[0], and likewise, the third bubble solution is
        solution #2 and has the score in scores[2].</h2>

    <h4>To access an item of the array we use
        this syntax: the variable name of the
        array followed by the index of the item,
        surrounded by square brackets.</h4>
