    <h1>And when it's done... The logic of the body
        has been carried out (and, in this example, you’ll see
        that Rover, being 23 pounds, sounds like “WOOF
        WOOF”), and the function is done. After the function
        completes, then control is returned to the statement
        following our call to bark.</h1>
