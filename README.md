	##The variable without equsl sign : We say optionally, because if you want, you can create a variable without
	an initial value, and then assign it a value later. To create a variable
	without an initial value, just leave off the assignment part, like this:

	##A variable can hold are numbers string and the bollean values.

	##What’s a keyword?
	A: A keyword is a reserved word in
	JavaScript. JavaScript uses these reserved
	words for its own purposes, and it would
	be confusing to you and the browser if you
	started using them for your variables.

	##Q: What exactly is a block of code?
	A: Syntactically, a block of code (which
	we usually just call a block) is a set of
	statements, which could be one statement,
	or as many as you like, grouped together
	between curly braces. Once you’ve got a
	block of code, all the statements in that
	block are treated as a group to be executed
	together. For instance, all the statements
	within the block in a while statement are
	executed if the condition of the while is true.
	The same holds for a block in an if or else if.
