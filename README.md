	##The variable without equsl sign : We say optionally, because if you want, you can create a variable without
	an initial value, and then assign it a value later. To create a variable
	without an initial value, just leave off the assignment part, like this:

	##A variable can hold are numbers string and the bollean values.

	##What’s a keyword?
	A: A keyword is a reserved word in
	JavaScript. JavaScript uses these reserved
	words for its own purposes, and it would
	be confusing to you and the browser if you
	started using them for your variables.

	##Q: What exactly is a block of code?
	A: Syntactically, a block of code (which
	we usually just call a block) is a set of
	statements, which could be one statement,
	or as many as you like, grouped together
	between curly braces. Once you’ve got a
	block of code, all the statements in that
	block are treated as a group to be executed
	together. For instance, all the statements
	within the block in a while statement are
	executed if the condition of the while is true.
	The same holds for a block in an if or else if.  
	eg {
	}

	
	## What is psecdocode and how it works.
	DECLARE three variables to hold the location of each cell of the ship. Let’s call them
	location1, location2 and location3.
	DECLARE a variable to hold the user’s current guess. Let’s call it guess.
	DECLARE a variable to hold the number of hits. We’ll call it hits and set it to 0.
	DECLARE a variable to hold the number of guesses. We’ll call it guesses and set it to 0.
	DECLARE a variable to keep track of whether the ship is sunk or not. Let’s call it isSunk
	and set it to false.
	
	##If you don’t provide an initial
	value for a variable, then
	JavaScript gives it a default value of
	undefined. Think of the value undefined
	as JavaScript’s way of saying “this variable
	hasn’t been given a value yet.”
	
	If we click cancel in in the prompt dialog box the value returns null.
	
	##Comparison Operators
	Comparison operators compare
	two values. Here are some common
	comparison operators:
	<
	>
	==
	===
	<=
	>=
	!=
	means “less than”
	means “greater than”
	means “equal to”
	means “exactly equal to” (we’ll
	come back to this one later!)
	means “less than or equal to”
	means “greater than or equal to”
	means “not equal to”
	
	let buyIt = (inStock || onSale);
	let buyIt = (inStock && onSale);
	
	true true = true // true
	true false = true // false
	false true = true // false
	false false = false //false
	
	var randomLoc = Math.floor(Math.random() * 5);
	We can use Math.floor to round down all these
	numbers to their nearest integer value.
	
	
	Let conisderes a postive number as #true# and a negative number as #false#
	##OR operator taken as *plus* and && Operator is taken as *Multiply*
